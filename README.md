# How to Use
You'll need to first download the "Amazon product co-purchasing network metadata" dataset here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html. Then unzip the resulting file and more amazon-meta.txt into this directory.
Running "python3 DataParser.py" will get you the first ten items with their ASIN, product group, and co-purchased items.
